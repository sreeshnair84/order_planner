- [ ] Terraform installed (version 1.6.0 or later)
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Python 3.11+ installed
- [ ] Access to Azure subscription with Contributor rights

### Configuration
- [ ] Created `terraform/terraform.tfvars` from `terraform.tfvars.example`
- [ ] Updated PostgreSQL admin password (secure password)
- [ ] Configured SendGrid API key
- [ ] Set JWT secret key (32+ characters)
- [ ] Reviewed and set appropriate SKUs for your environment

### SendGrid Setup
- [ ] Created SendGrid account
- [ ] Generated API key with Mail Send permissions
- [ ] Verified sender email address
- [ ] Added SendGrid API key to terraform.tfvars

### Azure Subscription
- [ ] Verified Azure subscription has sufficient quotas
- [ ] Confirmed region availability for all services
- [ ] Checked cost estimates for selected SKUs

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Infrastructure Deployment
- [ ] Navigate to terraform directory (`cd terraform`)
- [ ] Run `terraform init`
- [ ] Run `terraform plan` and review changes
- [ ] Run `terraform apply` and confirm deployment
- [ ] Save terraform outputs for later use

### Step 2: Backend Deployment
- [ ] Copy backend code to Azure Functions directory
- [ ] Create deployment package (`zip -r function-app.zip .`)
- [ ] Deploy to Azure Functions using Azure CLI
- [ ] Verify function app is running (check `/health` endpoint)

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Install frontend dependencies (`npm install`)
- [ ] Build React app (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Create deployment package (`zip -r build.zip build/`)
- [ ] Deploy to Azure Web App using Azure CLI
- [ ] Verify web app is running

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Infrastructure Verification
- [ ] All Azure resources created successfully
- [ ] PostgreSQL database accessible
- [ ] Redis cache operational
- [ ] Storage account created with container
- [ ] Application Insights collecting data
- [ ] Key Vault contains all secrets

### Application Verification
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Backend API responds to health check
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Redis cache functioning
- [ ] File upload functionality working
- [ ] Email notifications working (test with SendGrid)

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] Managed identities assigned properly
- [ ] Key Vault access policies configured
- [ ] Secrets stored securely (not in code)

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Application Insights showing telemetry
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Auto-scaling configured if needed

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Function App Issues
**Problem**: Function app not starting
**Solutions**:
- Check Application Insights logs
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Check function app settings

#### Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: Cannot connect to PostgreSQL
**Solutions**:
- Verify connection string in Key Vault
- Check PostgreSQL firewall rules
- Ensure managed identity has database permissions
- Test connection from Azure Cloud Shell

#### CORS Issues
**Problem**: Frontend cannot call backend API
**Solutions**:
- Verify CORS settings in Function App
- Check frontend API URL configuration
- Ensure HTTPS is used for all calls
- Review browser console for detailed errors

#### Storage Issues
**Problem**: File upload not working
**Solutions**:
- Check storage account permissions
- Verify container exists and is accessible
- Review storage connection string
- Test with Azure Storage Explorer

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check resource status
az resource list --resource-group <resource-group> --output table

# View Function App logs
az functionapp log tail --name <function-app-name> --resource-group <resource-group>

# View Web App logs
az webapp log tail --name <web-app-name> --resource-group <resource-group>

# Test database connection
az postgres flexible-server connect --name <server-name> --admin-user <username>

# Check Key Vault secrets
az keyvault secret list --vault-name <key-vault-name>

# Monitor Application Insights
az monitor app-insights query --app <app-insights-name> --analytics-query "requests | limit 10"
```

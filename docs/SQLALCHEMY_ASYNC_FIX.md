# SQLAlchemy Async Fix Summary

## Problem
The backend was throwing `MissingGreenlet` errors when trying to access lazy-loaded relationships in SQLAlchemy async sessions. Specifically, when the routes API endpoint tried to serialize `Route` objects that include `Manufacturer` objects with their `retailers` relationship, SQLAlchemy couldn't load the lazy relationship because it was outside of an async context.

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The `RouteResponse` Pydantic model includes a `ManufacturerResponse` 
2. `ManufacturerResponse` includes a `retailers` field (many-to-many relationship)
3. The routes API endpoints were only eagerly loading the `Route.manufacturer` relationship with `selectinload(Route.manufacturer)`
4. They were NOT loading the `Manufacturer.retailers` relationship
5. When Pydantic tried to serialize the response, it attempted to access the lazy-loaded `retailers` attribute outside of an async context

## Solution
Fixed all route-related endpoints to properly eagerly load both the manufacturer and its retailers relationships:

### Routes Endpoints Fixed:
1. **GET /api/management/routes** - List routes with pagination
2. **GET /api/management/routes/{route_id}** - Get single route
3. **POST /api/management/routes** - Create new route
4. **PUT /api/management/routes/{route_id}** - Update route

### Manufacturer Endpoints Fixed:
1. **POST /api/management/manufacturers** - Create manufacturer
2. **PUT /api/management/manufacturers/{manufacturer_id}** - Update manufacturer

### Retailer Endpoints Fixed:
1. **POST /api/management/retailers** - Create retailer
2. **PUT /api/management/retailers/{retailer_id}** - Update retailer

## Changes Made

### For Route Endpoints:
```python
# Before:
query = select(Route).options(selectinload(Route.manufacturer))

# After:
query = select(Route).options(
    selectinload(Route.manufacturer).selectinload(Manufacturer.retailers)
)
```

### For Create/Update Endpoints:
Added proper relationship loading after commit/refresh:
```python
# After commit and refresh, reload with proper relationships
route_query = select(Route).options(
    selectinload(Route.manufacturer).selectinload(Manufacturer.retailers)
).where(Route.id == route.id)
route_result = await db.execute(route_query)
route = route_result.scalar_one()
return route
```

## Files Modified:
- `c:\project\order_planner\backend\app\api\management.py`

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Start the backend server
2. Run the test script: `python test_route_fix.py`
3. Check that the routes API endpoint returns data without errors
4. Verify that manufacturer and retailer relationships are properly loaded

The fix ensures that all necessary relationships are eagerly loaded before Pydantic attempts to serialize the response, preventing the `MissingGreenlet` async SQLAlchemy error.

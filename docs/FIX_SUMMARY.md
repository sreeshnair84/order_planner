# FastAPI Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was throwing an error in the ASGI application at the routing level, specifically in the Starlette routing middleware.

## Root Cause
The error was likely caused by:
1. **Missing default values for `updated_at` columns** in the database models
2. **None values being passed to Pydantic models** that expect datetime objects
3. **Type conversion issues** between SQLAlchemy Numeric types and Python float/Decimal types

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Model Updates
- Fixed `updated_at` columns in `Order` and `User` models to have `server_default=func.now()`
- This ensures that `updated_at` is never `None` when creating new records

### 2. Response Model Improvements
- Added a factory method `OrderResponse.from_order()` to handle safe type conversion
- Added null-safe handling for all numeric fields (`or 0` fallbacks)
- Added fallback logic for `updated_at` field (`updated_at or created_at`)

### 3. API Endpoint Updates
- Updated all order endpoints to use the new factory method
- This ensures consistent and safe response serialization

### 4. Type Safety
- Added proper handling for SQLAlchemy Numeric -> Python float conversion
- Added safe fallbacks for all optional fields

## Files Modified
1. `backend/app/models/order.py` - Fixed updated_at column
2. `backend/app/models/user.py` - Fixed updated_at column  
3. `backend/app/api/requestedorders.py` - Added factory method and updated endpoints
4. `backend/scripts/fix_updated_at_migration.py` - Migration script for existing data

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify imports and basic functionality
- Added migration script to fix existing database records

## Result
The application should now handle datetime fields properly and avoid the ASGI routing errors that were occurring when trying to serialize response objects.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Complete Order Processing
```python
# Create agent and process order completely
agent = OrderProcessingAgent(db)
result = await agent.process_order_complete(
    order_id="uuid-here",
    order_number="ORD-001"
)
```

### 2. Step-by-Step Processing
```python
# Process specific steps with human oversight
result = await agent.process_order_step(
    order_id="uuid-here",
    step_name="validate",
    step_params={"validation_type": "completeness"}
)
```

### 3. API Usage
```javascript
// Create agent thread from frontend
const response = await fetch('/api/ai-agent/threads', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    order_id: 'uuid-here',
    message: 'Please process this order completely',
    auto_start: true
  })
});
```

## Database Schema

### AIAgentThread Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_agent_threads (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
    thread_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR NOT NULL,

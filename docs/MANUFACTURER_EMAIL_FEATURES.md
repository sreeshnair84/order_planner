## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive manufacturer assignment capabilities and email management features to the Order Planning System. The FMCG company can now assign manufacturers to retailers and manage the complete order lifecycle through email communications.

## Key Features

### 1. Manufacturer Management
- **Create/Edit/Delete Manufacturers**: Full CRUD operations for manufacturer records
- **Retailer-Manufacturer Assignments**: FMCG can link retailers to specific manufacturers
- **Manufacturer Order Tracking**: View all orders assigned to each manufacturer
- **Business Details**: Lead times, minimum order values, payment terms

### 2. Email Management System
- **Email Communications Tracking**: View all emails sent for orders
- **Manual Email Sending**: Send custom emails for specific orders
- **Email Templates**: Pre-defined templates for different email types
- **Email Status Tracking**: Pending, Sent, Failed status tracking
- **Resend Failed Emails**: Retry functionality for failed emails

### 3. Order Actions & Consolidation
- **Order Processing Triggers**: Manually trigger order processing
- **Order Consolidation**: Combine multiple orders for efficient processing
- **Action-based Workflow**: Different actions available based on order status
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple orders for batch operations

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created:
1. **manufacturers** - Manufacturer information and business details
2. **retailers** - Retailer information and contact details
3. **retailer_manufacturer_association** - Many-to-many relationship table
4. **routes** - Shipping routes between manufacturers and destinations

### Updated Tables:
- **orders** - Added manufacturer assignment fields:
  - `retailer_id` - Foreign key to retailers table
  - `manufacturer_id` - Foreign key to manufacturers table  
  - `assigned_by` - User who made the assignment
  - `assigned_at` - Timestamp of assignment
  - `assignment_notes` - Notes about the assignment

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
- Added "Manufacturers" menu item with factory icon
- Added "Email Management" menu item with mail icon
- Updated layout to accommodate new features

## Workflow Integration

### FMCG Assignment Workflow:
1. **Order Upload**: Retailer uploads order file
2. **Order Parsing**: System parses and validates order data
3. **FMCG Review**: FMCG reviews orders in management dashboard
4. **Manufacturer Assignment**: FMCG assigns manufacturer to order
5. **Order Processing**: Manufacturer processes assigned orders
6. **Email Notifications**: Automated emails at each stage
7. **Order Consolidation**: Multiple orders can be consolidated

### Email Communication Flow:
1. **Automatic Emails**: System generates emails for order events
2. **Manual Emails**: FMCG can send custom emails
3. **Email Tracking**: All emails tracked in communication log
4. **Failed Email Handling**: Failed emails can be retried
5. **Order-specific Emails**: View all emails for specific orders

## Business Logic

### Manufacturer Assignment Rules:
- Only FMCG users can assign manufacturers to orders
- Retailers must be pre-assigned to manufacturers
- Orders can only be assigned to manufacturers linked to the retailer
- Assignment creates audit trail with user and timestamp

### Order Consolidation Rules:
- Only orders with same manufacturer can be consolidated
- Orders must be in valid status (UPLOADED, PARSED, VALIDATED, ASSIGNED)
- Consolidated orders get single tracking and communication
- Consolidation generates notification emails

### Email Management Rules:
- All order-related emails are tracked in database
- Email templates based on order type and status
- Failed emails can be retried with same content
- Email history maintained for audit purposes

## Migration Instructions

### Database Migration:
1. Run the migration script: `python backend/scripts/migrate_manufacturer_assignment.py`
2. Or use the batch file: `run_migration.bat`

### Sample Data:
The migration includes sample manufacturers and retailers:

**Manufacturers:**
- ABC Manufacturing (ABC001) - Chicago, IL
- XYZ Production (XYZ002) - Detroit, MI  
- Global Suppliers Inc (GSI003) - Houston, TX

**Retailers:**
- Mega Retail Corp (MRC001) - New York, NY
- Quick Mart Chain (QMC002) - Los Angeles, CA
- Super Store Network (SSN003) - Miami, FL

## Security Considerations

### Access Control:
- Manufacturer assignment requires authenticated FMCG user
- Email sending requires valid user session
- Retailer-manufacturer relationships are protected
- Order consolidation requires appropriate permissions

### Data Validation:
- All manufacturer assignments validated against existing relationships
- Email addresses validated before sending
- Order consolidation rules enforced at API level
- Input sanitization for all user-provided data

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes:
- Added indexes on foreign key columns for faster joins
- Manufacturer and retailer code indexes for quick lookups
- Order assignment indexes for efficient queries

### Query Optimizations:
- Use of `selectinload` for eager loading relationships
- Bulk operations for order consolidation
- Efficient pagination for large datasets

## Error Handling

### Order Assignment Errors:
- Manufacturer not found
- Retailer not assigned to manufacturer
- Order already assigned
- Invalid order status for assignment

### Email Errors:
- Invalid email addresses
- SMTP server failures
- Template rendering errors
- Order not found for email

### Consolidation Errors:
- Mismatched manufacturers
- Invalid order statuses
- Insufficient orders for consolidation
- Database constraint violations

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests:
- Manufacturer CRUD operations
- Retailer-manufacturer assignment logic
- Email generation and sending
- Order consolidation business rules

### Integration Tests:
- End-to-end manufacturer assignment workflow
- Email communication flow
- Order consolidation process
- API endpoint testing

### UI Tests:
- Manufacturer management interface
- Email management dashboard
- Order action buttons and modals
- Navigation and routing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Advanced Email Templates**: Rich HTML email templates with branding
2. **Email Scheduling**: Schedule emails for future delivery
3. **Manufacturer Performance Metrics**: KPIs and analytics dashboard
4. **Automated Assignment Rules**: AI-based manufacturer assignment
5. **Mobile App Integration**: Mobile interface for manufacturers
6. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket-based real-time updates
7. **Document Management**: File attachments for emails and orders
8. **Approval Workflows**: Multi-step approval process for assignments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
